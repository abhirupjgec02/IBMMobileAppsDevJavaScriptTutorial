    2. Install the all necessary files which are required to run the react application by running this command.:
        Command --> npm install 

    3.Then in the terminal write given commands to update scripts in package.json file and hit enter:
        Command --> npm pkg set scripts.lint="eslint . --ext js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0" 
        Command --> npm pkg set scripts.preview="vite build && vite preview --host"
