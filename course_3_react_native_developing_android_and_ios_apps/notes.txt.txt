Redux toolkit usage process steps : 1. Creating the slice --> Define the states and logic to modify the reducers for a specific feature.
									2. Configuring the store --> Serves as the central repository for the application state. Also holds the state tree, and handles 
																	dispatching actions to the appropriate reducers.
									3. Connecting the store to the react applciation --> Also allows components to interact with the global state. 
																							The Provider component from react-redux, makes the store available to the rest of the app.
									4. Interact with the store --> Using useSelector and useDispatch functions to mofidy the state as needed.
